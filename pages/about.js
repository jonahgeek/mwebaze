                I'm a full-stack engineer with 13+ years of experience. I
                started my career back in 2007 as a designer, then quickly
                started coding as well.

                <br />
                I've seen it all. In my career I've worked with a lot of
                technologies: PHP, MooTools, jQuery, Ruby on Rails, Angular,
                ReactJS, GraphQL, and many more.
