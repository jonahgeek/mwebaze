I don't want to waste your time with this article so I'll say it upfront,
**the right way of getting into coding doesn't exist.** Now that we get that out of the way lets get started. This is highly focused on
my own experience, I started coding in 2007.

# How to get into coding

If you've been on Twitter I bet you've seen accounts bullshitting their way into
_teaching you the right way to code_, BS. They _say_ after HTML + CSS
you **should** learn JavaScript basics before jumping into libraries.

When I started learning how to code I had no idea what the hell I was doing,
as most of us. I started learning HTML + CSS, the concept of a `div` being a box
was too much for me, it's perfectly normal thinking and questioning every single thing
about coding.

Now per almost everyone I **had** to jump into JavaScript basics, well, I didn't. I went
straight from HTML + CSS into PHP, and you know what? It's fine. Back in the day, I was
using PHP for frontend development. I've been called a noob and that _"I don't know how to code at all"_
because I used PHP for frontend, if you're one of those folks I can honestly say â€” screw you.

Back to JavaScript, again, before learning the basics I started learning jQuery straight away,
the basics came later, and once again it was fine.

# Your way is the right way

I agree if you're working with a team you **should** follow best practices, but again, each
team has its own way of working, you'd need to adapt to their way from project to project.

What happened to me by not _learning things the **right** way_ was that I'm curious,
eager to learn and most importantly I keep on building stuff, even after 13+ years.

If you want to learn PHP or Ruby on Rails just do it. It's OK to follow some advice here and there,
but sometimes it's just too much, it feels like _experienced_ folks are putting too much
pressure on you to follow the right way.

Sometime we're taking advice from folks that never built a single application in their
life, now tell me, if they've never built an application how the hell are they in a position
of telling others how they should learn how to code? Spoiler alert, **they're not**.
