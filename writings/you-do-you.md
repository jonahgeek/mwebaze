I've created my first Twitter account back in 2007, I didn't really cared too much about it, just another social network, I wasn't wrong though. When Twitter first launched it was just a way of sharing with your *followers* what you were doing, you would often see tweets such as *"Heading to the movies."*, *"God, this coffee is gold."*, just banal, regular non-sense stuff.

# 2020

In January of 2020 I've started to engage a little more on Twitter, trying to share useful coding tips, jokes, all sort of stuff that I thought people would be interested, once you see people are engaging with what you share you get hooked right away.

As the months passed by I started to realize it wasn't *me* sharing the content, it felt like my account was on auto-pilot, I knew what people liked, I knew what would give a tweet that *so needed* boost, I had to stop that, I started sharing only what I **want** to share, not really caring about if people like it or not.

# Are you sure?

Another thing I realised was that a lot of people use Twitter sort of as a source of truth. *"Wow, if this account with 40K followers is saying I need a YouTube channel maybe I do need one, let me take care of that."*, don't fall for this, create a YouTube channel **only** if you want one.

It starts to get a little overwhelming for beginners, they read so many crap on Twitter that many just end up giving up because they think they need to own the world to become a developer.

# You do you

I've been coding for 13 years and aside from this year I never had a YouTube Channel, I never had a big Twitter following, I never had an active website or blog, I don't participate on the DEV community as many do.

Oh right, I almost **never** code on the weekends. I must be such a shitty developer because I take breaks and time for my family.


I've followed my path without any of these things, it doesn't mean I'm more or less of a developer as any of you.

**You do you**, focus on that and don't let people put you down by saying you need to know and have it all.
