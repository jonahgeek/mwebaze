I usually focus my content on stuff I see on Twitter, this will be no different. I've
been on Twitter since 2007, I've had several accounts but only started focusing more on content and
trying to help beginners since January this year.

Anyway, I've seen so many people saying they have been rejected from job interviews, and let us
be honest—**it fucking sucks**.

---

Main focus here is **don't give up**, something will turn up eventually, if it hasn't already.
Rejection sucks, I've been there, I bet you that at least 99% developer have been there.

It happens, but take note, that doesn't mean you're not qualified for the role, sometimes it
can just be luck with the interviewers. You know that **click**? That doesn't happen only with
relationships.

While we're here, let me tell you a story. Back in 2012 I moved to London and in the first 2 weeks
I was there I applied to hundreds of applications and went to 7 interviews. I'm Portuguese, one of the interviews was with 2 Portuguese guys, obviously I wasn't expecting to get the job just _because_
we were all Portuguese, although you get the feeling that it might help—well it didn't.

After a few days I got called for another interview, I was sceptical because it was a fintech company,
not at all what I was comfortable with—I went anyway, guess what—I got the job.

---

My take from this interview? Probably around 2 months before I went into this interview I
had the idea to build an application to manage expenses, invoices and more.

I went with Ruby on Rails, built a bunch of charts using HighchartsJS and released it, well, the
stack of this company was pretty much all I used on my pet project. I'm guessing if for some reason
I haven't built this pet project I wouldn't be able to get the job.

---

After that I had plenty of interviews, all rejected—it happens. My girlfriend always says
_"If it didn't happen it's because it wasn't meant to be."_, and she's so right, if it weren't
for all the rejections I wouldn't be where I am today.

Keep it going because you got this.
