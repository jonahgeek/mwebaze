First of all, if you haven't already, follow the link to install [The Gnome Tweak Tool](http://localhost:3000/writings/install-gnome-tweak-tool-ubuntu-20.04)

Now open your Mozilla firefox and go to https://extensions.gnome.org/. If you don't already have an account, register for a gnome account and log in.
